            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For this project I reviewed three AI tools that I had never used before. They were: Gamma, a presentation & design tool; Runway, a video production tool; and Open AI’s Sora, another video production tool. I chose these three as I don’t have much experience with using visual content generators, and was interested in how I might be able to apply them in personal, professional, and academic roles.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Tool 1: Gamma</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>The first tool I tried was Gamma, the presentation & design tool. Its primary use seems to be designing powerpoint presentations, though it technically had capabilities for websites, portfolios, and social media posts (though these mostly came out looking like powerpoints). The tool itself works by giving it a prompt, having it generate a page concept overview (anywhere from 1-10 pages on the free account) and allowing you to edit the individual page prompts. From there, you can decide the color scheme and image sourcing. One of my favorite features was the option to choose where the inputted images were coming from. By default it AI generates the images, but you can easily swap that over to using free-to-use stock images or random images from online. For the online setting you can have it sort by freely licensed images or let it use any image regardless of licensing. Then, you can generate the entire presentation from there. This creates a fully editable and customizable presentation that comes pre-filled with useful but very generic information - which could be a good starting point for creating your own presentation. The UI is fairly clear and everything is easily editable, though I didn’t get into the nitty-gritty details on how far the manual editing can go.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>
            I feel Gamma is one of the most useful AI tools I’ve come across, with it easily creating simple powerpoint layouts and templates for you to use, though you’ll likely want to replace much of the body text as it is pretty generic and bland.
            </p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p> I really appreciated the ability for you to disable the AI generated images, which I feel allows you to avoid the worst of the ethical issues that these tools encounter. Be mindful of what type of image you're sorting by as it may pull copyrighted material by accident.</p>

            <h2>Tool 2: Runway</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>The second tool I tried was Runway, an AI powered video generation tool. The free trial for this one was extremely limited - a single 5 second video on an old model. These also required a source image in addition to a prompt describing what happened. While it was able to mostly generate a coherent scene, the age of the model meant it was pretty limited and visually pretty bad. I can’t think of much of a use case for this program. The version I was allowed to try resulted in pretty bad results, so I just left it since I wasn’t allowed to experiment.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>In theory it could be used to generate concept arts and materials, but the results were pretty low quality, and it is comparitatively to use.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>Be mindful of what images you insert as it will work with copyrighted material as far as I can tell. Additionally, any generated videos can be used to spread disinformation and confusion easily, so be mindful of how you're using it. </p>

            <h2>Tool 3: Sora AI</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Since Runway didn’t go well I decided to try out OpenAI’s Sora, one of the most impressive video generators out there (from my understanding). The free plan allows for ten, ten second videos daily which have a significantly higher quality than Runway’s. These can range from stylized to photo-realistic and everything in between. However, the details of the videos are usually pretty fuzzy and inconsistent. The videos often have clipping issues where people and objects phase through each other or just randomly disappear.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>I’m unsure of any actual practical use cases for Sora though. While good, the videos are still short and don’t look very good since there is little consistency between scenes and objects. Additionally, the one thing it seems to be very good at is faking real life people and their voices. For instance, there were many videos people had posted in its integrated viewing site of a reporter or politician making a bizarre comment or remark that I would have thought were real if they weren’t posted to an AI website. So the one thing it seems to be consistently useful for is getting people riled up over fake videos of real people. It is fun to play with, but I’m not sure the cost is worth it.
            </p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>Sora is probably the most ethically dubious of the three, since it is capable of easily replicating both copyrighted material and real people to puppet them around for whatever the prompter asks for. There are some attempted limits in place, with outright naming copyrighted material often forces it to halt generation, but these are fairly easy to get around if you simply describe what you want rather than naming it outright. Additionally, most of the data and material it is trained on is likely not with permission, given the sheer volume of videos mimicking copyrighted material that users have made.

            <h2>Broader Reflections</h2>
            <p>In the future I imagine I could use tools like Gamma to assist in my workflow for professional and academic work. Tools like Gamma help streamline tedious portions of workflows rather than replace critical content and sourcing. Additionally, its customizability and option to not use AI generated images avoid most of the ethical issues that come with generative AI. While its filler text isn’t the highest quality (and doesn’t easily provide sources for its information) its helpful as a temporary measure to pace out the presentation rather than use it in the end product.</p>
            <p>These AI tools provide a great opportunity for completely overhauling the workflows of countless jobs, courses, and many aspects of life. However, AI also poses the threat of heavy environmental damage, copyright infrigement, and even disaster in the job market as positions are hastily replaced with AI and blindly trusted to work just as well as a professional. I could see AI being used as a tool in DCDA as a way to accentuate and improve our current abilities rather than fully replace. I feel that human creativity still has a place in DCDA work that AI will likely never be able to replace. Finding patterns in weird places, deciding to focus on a niche subject, or even human oversight of AI processes will be a continuing need for the foreseeable future.
