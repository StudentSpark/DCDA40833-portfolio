            <h2>Critique</h2>
            
            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>At first glance, this graphic seems to be fairly simple and informative. It shows the rapid increase of safer cooking fuel in Indonesia from 2000 to 2016. However, I believe that it largely fails by Tufte’s standards, as it does nothing to explain why this happened or how it is significant.
                Starting with the overall design of the graphic, it is clean, undistracting, and fairly simple. However, all of it is a complete waste of space. All it demonstrates is worth a single line of text: “In 2000 5% of Indonesians had access to clean cooking fuel. In 2016, that number rose to 58%.” Additionally, the 10x10 grid of squares representing the percentages of the population does little to help visualize how much of the population has access to safe fuel. At the scale presented, the two data points blur into “small” and “much bigger” without giving any more context or even any humanizing aspects like representing the people struggling with dangerous fuels. Another issue of the graphic is that it doesn’t even explain what a dirty fuel or clean fuel is. Further research reveals that dirty fuels include materials like wood, coal, or kerosene, and clean fuels are liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or electricity. Critical context like this would be important to include on the graphic.
                The original source that this graphic is based on goes into much more detail on the significance of this achievement. The first thing mentioned in the article is the high mortality rate associated with indoor and outdoor air pollution, with it being the second most common cause of death by risk factor in the world as of 2021, with over 8 million people dying that year alone from it. Information like this gives important context as to why this should be celebrated as good news, or if it's good news at all.</p>

            <h3>Additional Concern 1: Effects Without Causes</h3>
            <p>Another issue with the graphic is that it describes the effects without cause. While it is stated that significantly more people in Indonesia have access to cleaner cooking fuel, it is not stated how this is happening. Even the article it is based on doesn’t go into any more detail than “increased access.” The only mention of why this is happening is listed in the description of the graphic, referencing a “Clean Stove initiative” in 2012, but does not provide a source on this initiative. 
            </p>

            <h3>Additional Concern 2: Cherry-Picking</h3>
            <p>Finally, this graphic suffers from cherry picking, as it gives a very limited view of the data, with only two data points across sixteen years. There is no context on when this increase in safe fuel usage started. It is unknown if the 2012 initiative mentioned in the description was the primary cause of the higher usage of cleaner fuels or if there was already an established upwards trend. Additionally, there is no context on whether this is better, worse, or in-line with other countries that are also dealing with high rates of dangerous cooking fuel usage. While the data may be honest and it is a major improvement compared to other countries and regions, there is no way to know based on the limited information provided by the graphic.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, this graphic does very little to convey useful information to the viewer. Filled with chart junk, lacking context, and doing nothing to improve the message stated by the title, this graphic fails Tufte’s requirements on almost every count. Its only saving grace is that it is a clean and eye-catching design.
