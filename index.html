            <p>Welcome to my DCDA 40833 portfolio! Here, you'll find the various projects I worked on throughout the semester, which include topics on AI and data visualization.  </p>
            <p>Each of these projects showcase my development and growth in Digital Cultre and Data Analytics.</p>

            <!-- TODO: Replace this placeholder content with information about yourself -->
            <p><strong>Who I am:</strong> My name is Stephen Park, I am a Senior DCDA major. </p>
            <p><strong>My interests:</strong> Although I have a heavy interest in technology, DCDA's interdiciplinary approach and inclusion of the humanitieds allows me to explore my interest in liberal arts. As a generalist, the combination of technology and the humanities allows me to explore more opportunities in a variety of fields.</p>
            <p><strong>What I hope to learn:</strong> One topic i'm looking forward to is learning how to set up webpages and formatting with HTML and CSS. Additionally, I'm excited to test my knowledge and expertiese by managing and creating a research project!</p>

            <h2>Semester Reflection</h2>
            <!-- TODO: After completing all labs, write a reflection on your growth -->
            <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> This was the first time I've ever really worked with HTML or CSS. While a little difficult to make something that actually looks good, I think I'm getting the basics pretty well! So far its been pretty interesting. I've also enjoyed finally learning how to use and take advantage of Github for the first time. Looking forward to having a nice place to manage and store projects.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges I overcame:</strong> The biggest technical difficulties I've encountered so far have been figuring out how Github works with all its hook-ups, browser vs client programs, and all the web hosting. I'm also getting used to CSS pages, and figuring out how to find the colors I want to change. A non-technical challenge I encountered was finding ways to concisely write out intros and explain why I'm in to DCDA.</p>
            <p><strong>How I grew:</strong> [How did your understanding of digital culture and data analytics evolve?]</p>
            <p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> [How will you apply these skills in the future?]</p>
